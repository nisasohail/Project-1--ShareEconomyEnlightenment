Are you enamored with the vintage style of a bygone era? Do you enjoy camping, but secretly wish you had a real bed, wifi and a bathroom? If so, the Dixie Daisy is for you! This cute Airstream trailer has been completely renovated with a retro twist. It’s the perfect place to escape for a relaxing weekend surrounded by nature, yet equipped with the conveniences of home. Grill up a yummy dinner with your honey and dine al fresco on the large deck, take a morning stroll along the creek, turn on the string lights for some mood lighting, take a dip in the hot tub, enjoy your morning shower under the trees in the private, spacious outdoor shower (room for two!), and end your day relaxing by the fire with an ice cold beer. This is the life! \n\nThe Dixie Daisy provides all the comforts of home in one cute, cozy package. The antique iron bedframe holds a queen mattress, the bathroom has a small interior shower and a real toilet, the kitchen is fully equipped with dishes and utensils, and alongside the deck is a charcoal grill and fire bowl for your night-time fire. The owners really go out of their way to add those special touches to make your trip complete, such as leaving fresh eggs in the fridge (as long as the chickens keep up) and local organic coffee. They also strive to make this property as green as possible by using environmentally friendly dish soap and laundry detergent, providing recycled paper products and full recycling, using low-wattage light bulbs, and more.\n\nThis cozy retreat is nestled in an elm grove along the banks of Smith Creek on 10 beautiful acres shared with the owners. You’ll really feel like you’ve escaped to nature, yet the fabulous shopping and dining of downtown Wimberley are only 3 miles down the road. It’s the best of both worlds! So, what are you waiting for? The Dixie Daisy is the unique getaway you’ve been dreaming of. We are confident that it will exceed your expectations!\n\nPet policy:\nPets are allowed for a fee of $50 per pet, and we ask that you leave cash or check for the pet fee with the keys upon checkout. Pets must be declared to the owners in advance, preferably at the time of booking.

Just shoot us a message with your date and we'll go from there.\n\nWe strive to give our guests as much privacy as possible, but you may see us from time to time during your stay.

I built the little house on the hill as a micro home; it has everything a home has in a very small package. I truly love this home and can’t wait to share it with you!\n\nThe Little House on the Hill has a beautiful country view and atmosphere just minutes from everything Austin has to offer.\n\nThe little house is a beautifully hand crafted 340 sq. ft. micro home built on top of a hill overlooking the south Austin skyline. The cottage can comfortably accommodate up to 2 adults. Inside there is a full kitchen, full-size loft bed, walk-in-shower, 40 inch flat screen TV with basic cable channels, sm. couch and small folding table and chair. \n\n********************PLEASE NOTE***********************\nWe DO NOT offer internet in the house, however we have fantastic LTE cell-phone service with most carriers (att, t-mobile, version, sprint) so that you can still enjoy internet through your smart phone.\n*****************************************************************\n\nThe kitchen has brand new stainless steel appliances, which include a microwave, gas oven and stove, refrigerator and reclaimed vintage cast iron sink set in a custom concrete counter top. Coffee maker, pots, pans, dishes and utensils are also included in the kitchen. There is also a pantry to store dry groceries. We do not have a dish washer so you will be responsible for washing your dishes before leaving.\nCaffeinated coffee, creamer and sweetener are also included for your enjoyment.\n \nThe bathroom is full size and includes a large walk in shower with overhead lighting. The restroom is NOT separated by a door, therefore, minimal privacy is available while using the restroom facilities. This is a one room cottage; you will not want to stay here with someone you are not comfortable with, there is NO door for the toilet. Very open concept. Hand towels, bath towels, washcloths, toilet paper and hand soap are included during your stay. Please bring your own toiletries.\n\nBeside the bathroom and under the loft bed is a designated closet area which includes a cabinet for folded clothes, and a clothes rod for hanging garments. ABOVE the closet area is the full size bed, with a comfy foam mattress. Two alternative-down pillows and linens are provided.\nThe bed is 7 feet in the air and therefore, a ladder is used to access the bed, gaurd rails are set on either side of the bed for your added safety. In addition, the clearance above the bed is only 3 feet so it's very cozy.\n\nThe living room is simple with a sm. Ikea couch (not meant for sleeping unfortunately), a flat screen TV with basic local cable along with a small folding desk and single chair area for any working needs. \n\n A rear patio/deck with an amazing view of south Austin is included in your stay. A back patio for your enjoyment outdoors with dining table and chairs. \n\n*********************PLEASE NOTE**********************\nIf you are considering traveling with your pet, I apologize we are NO LONGER ALLOW PETS. \n*****************************************************************\n\nSmoking is NOT allowed inside the cabin, however you may step outside of the cabin onto the patio and enjoy lovely views and peaceful feelings are free.\n\nI do work on the property in a workshop on the acreage with 2 other employees most days of the week, I own my own company. I'm also in the process of building a home for our family along with another micro home. I have a german sheperd, Heidi who often accompanies me on work days. Please do not be afraid of her though, she is extremely friendly, but does have a big bark :) I also have a fiancé Rachel, and son who are often on the property, we are building for our homesite. My fiancé also has 3 dogs, all of which are friendly and range in size but are all loving rescue pups. Rachel, my son and her 3 dogs are currently off site until final construction of our homesite on the property. We would love to host you at our beautiful slice of paradise in Austin!\n\nHere are a few distances from the house to some common land marks in Austin:\nDistance to Bergstrom International Airport 6.4 miles \nDistance to Austin Executive Airport 13.4 miles \nDistance to Capital Plaza 8.5 miles (downtown) \nDistance to toll i-130 (fastest road in America 85 mph) 1 mile. \nDistance to Austin Expo Center (ROT Rally, F1 parking, many other events) 3.5 miles. \nDistance to the Circuit of the Americas 11.3 miles\n\nYou will need to have your own transportation at this location. \nYellow cab does service the address.\nThere is not a bus stop in walking distance. \nOur driveway is gravel and not paved.
